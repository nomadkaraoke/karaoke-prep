Well it's a big, big city and it's always the same
Can never be too pretty, tell me your name
Is it out of line if I were simply bold and say "Would you be mine?"
Because I may be a beggar and you may be the queen
I know I may be on a downer, I'm still ready to dream
Though it's three o'clock, the time is just the time it takes for you to talk


So if you're lonely, why'd you say you're not lonely?
Oh you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so
It's just like you to come and go
And know me, no, you don't even know me
You're so sweet to try, oh my, you caught my eye
A girl like you is just irresistible


Well it's a big, big city and the lights are all out
But it's as much as I can do you know to figure you out
And I must confess, my heart's in broken pieces and my head's a mess
And it's four in the morning and I'm walking along
Beside the ghost of every drinker here who's ever done wrong
And it's you, woo-hoo, that's got me going crazy for the things you do


So if you're crazy, I don't care, you amaze me
But you're a stupid girl, oh me, oh my, you talk
I die, you smile, you laugh, I cry
And only, a girl like you could be lonely
And it's a crying shame, if you would think the same
A boy like me is just irresistible



So if you're lonely, why'd you say you're not lonely?
Oh you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so
It's just like you to come and go
And know me, no, you don't even know me
You're so sweet to try, oh my, you caught my eye
A girl like you is just irresistible
